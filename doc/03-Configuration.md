# Configuration <a id="module-oidc-configuration"></a>
In order to use OIDC you first need to specify providers.
Get the following information from your Provider:
* Appname
* Secret
* redirect Url

When setting up this at your OIDC provider you need to specify an url the OIDC provider is allowed to redirect back after successful login:

``` http(s)://your-icingaweb2-instance/icingaweb2/oidc/realm?name=<name of the provider> ```

The redirect Url for the OIDC provider to redirect back to icinga in this particular case should look like this:
